In this program after providing an input (a pdf file) and a name for the output mp3 file you will recieve a text to speech version of said pdf.
In Pdfreaderinparts you will recieve the output in chuncks and in the other one it will be a big single mp3 file.
Both have pretty easy usage with some slight error checking, feel free to suggest any changes
